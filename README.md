# Running HW2 python file instructions

A guide to running HW2 python file

### Instructions

Make sure you have Python installed along with numpy and matplotlib before running this file.

I used Python version 2.7 and used pip3 to install numpy and matplotlib using the following commands

```pip3 install numpy```

```pip3 install matplotlib```

The final step is to make sure the path for input from line
``` path = open('/Users/nolandowdle/Desktop/CSC533/HW2/HW2/IL_employee_salary.csv') ``` 
points to the correct directory for your input CSV file.
You will need to change this to match your path.
